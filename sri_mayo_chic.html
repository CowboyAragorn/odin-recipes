        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sriracha Mayo Chicken is a simple but delicious recipe. 
                You are meant to form individual rice and chicken balls according to the recipe below, however this is not at all necessary. 
                Most of the time I end up forgoing this step and just make fried rice. 
                No matter how you choose to shape it, this dish will make a statement to whoever has the honor of consuming it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, stir together the chicken, mayonnaise, Sriracha, onions and celery. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In another mixing bowl, combine the rice and soy sauce.</li>
            <li>With wet hands, take a handful of rice in one hand, press together and flatten.</li>
            <li>Take a spoonful of the Sriracha mayo chicken and place in the center.</li>
            <li>Take another handful of rice and place on top. Using both hands, firmly press together the rice until you have a dense ball. Continue to form the rice until you have a fat triangle.</li>
            <li>Pan fry the Sriracha mayo chicken onigiri until lightly golden and crispy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
